# Lunch Team - 4/23

## Introductions

## Life during bootcamp / study habbits
### Fila's ten + three tips
1) Always pull the cohort Repo after class / before class (lecture slides / solutions / reviews)

2) Keep local repo organized - Important to study / review and in the future as a resource

3) Enjoy the struggle

4) Try to attend review sessions -> You already have a more solid comprehesion. Things will make more sense

5) During pair exercise: Prefer going together over going faster - Good oportunity to learn and teach

6) Don't worry about not finishing the workshop during class, BUT try to either watch the video solution, check the solution code or finish it later - extra tasks are a REALLY good source of information.

7) Keep a list of items you need to finish / want to review - Mine was called Event Loop
8) You might not need what you learned yestarday today - so you can review it later, or you might need it - you will have a chance to review it doing a different workshop

9) Start checkpoints as early as possible

10) Use resources available - instructors, fellows, PM, career team, other students

11) Sleep.
12) Sleep.
13) Sleep.
